        What we need to do is to regain the original purity of our hearts and become truly human. Only then can we die
        happily as humans with clarity. What I am showing you is the way up there. Quthbuzzaman has shown us the path to
        elevate those who approach with sincere intention, by nurturing the divine qualities within, and lead them to
        the
        lofty state of being God's most excellent creation. That is what I continue to do. It is the method of spiritual
        purification that will continue until the Day of Judgment. Quthbuzzaman taught us to look at the heart of a
        person, regardless of caste or creed. It is when one attains that blessed state of mind that one achieves
        complete
        success in life. That is what I guarantee.

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      Naeb Quthbuzzaman Dr. Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan Shah Qadiri Chishti is a Sufi
      master, socio-religious reformer, and a true champion of communal harmony, futuristic education, humanitarian
      healthcare, and philanthropic support. Being the current leading master of Qadiriyyah Sufi path of peace and love
      and the custodian of ‘Quthbuzzaman Jeelani Shareef - Kerala’, the global centre of peace and humanity, Dr. Sheikh
      Nizamudhin Sulthan Shah Qadiri Chishti is the successor of the renowned modern Indian Sufi master and scholar
      Hazrat / His Holiness Quthbuzzaman Dr. Shaikh Sufi Muhammad Yousuf Sulthan Shah Qadiri Chishti, the reviver of
      Sufism in modern Kerala and the founder of ‘Jeelani Trust’. With the evidently increased impetus and enormous
      growth and impact, Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan is taking forward Hazrat Quthbuzzaman’s multifaceted undertakings for
      rebuilding an ethical humanity and progressive unity among social and religious communities.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      Under the functional platform of Jeelani Trust and beyond, Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan carries out various missions,
      to cater the educational, health, economic, and spiritual needs and aspirations of the people within the region
      and outside. Dr. Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan is meticulously leading a devout and massive mission to bring about
      inspirational hope and eventual happiness to the humanity at large, widely opening the Sufi path of peace and
      love, practically and philosophically based on Islamic traditions and humanist outlook. He is the frontrunner of
      the ‘Jeelani’ movement of social reform and Sufi guidance, ‘Ghausiyya’ council of Islamic scholars, ‘Nizamia’
      ventures of Islamic and liberal education, and ‘Thaqdees’ enterprise for the healthcare and wellness. He has been
      also compassionate in leading several humanitarian charity missions across diverse social sectors, including
      education, health, public safety, etc. To the peace-seekers from various social and religious backgrounds who
      visit Quthbuzzaman Jeelani Shareef, Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan keenly attends with moral guidance and spiritual
      blessings.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      Being a socially committed Islamic leader with universal orientation, the Sufi social mission of Naeb Quthbuzzaman
      graciously represents two important themes of current global salience: social harmony and world peace. The
      predominant mission he undertakes, however, is that of a compassionate Sufi, set out to realize an ethically
      empowered and spiritually enlightened humanity. All his teachings and initiatives clearly emphasize that the noble
      task he accomplishes for all kinds of humans who reach out to him is careful guidance for ethical self-becoming.
      His public efforts to promote peace and harmony were also recognized by the Honorary Doctorate in ‘Human Rights &
      Peace’ (2021) conferred to him by the UN-accredited Globe Eagle University, authorized by the government of
      California, USA.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      In the sacred list (‘silsila’) of Qadiri Sufi masters, following Hzt. Quthbuzzaman’s Sufi path of spiritual
      perfection in Tawhid represented by the holy Prophetic examples, Naeb Quthbuzzaman Dr. Shaikh Nizamuddin Sulthan
      Shah Qadiri Chishti emerged as the 36th descendant of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and was chosen as the
      19th Sufi successor of Ghaus al-A’zam Shaikh Muhyiddin Abdul Qadir al-Jeelani (may he be blessed), the supreme
      master and the founder of Qadiri Sufi order at Baghdad. Taking up the phenomenal mission of reviving the original
      and humane spirit of din (religion), Naeb Quthbuzzaman also insists on returning to the more amicable path of
      traditional Islam the foundation of which is tauhid (divine unity) and thasawwuf (spiritual purity/Sufism). Unlike
      the exclusionary ideologies of the politically motivated fundamentalists and modern extremists, Naeb Quthbuzzaman
      treads in the virtuous footsteps of Hzt. Quthbuzzaman, seeking to revive the elemental Sufi vitality of Islamic
      tradition for its clarity of the concept of humanity and its practically sound methods of spiritual re-unification
      of human societies.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      Dr. Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan was born on 5th May 1975, at Aluva (Ernakulam), Kerala. He belongs to the scholarly
      household of ‘Vennipparambu’ which emerged in west-central Kerala centuries ago out of the Indo-Arab transregional
      connections in religion, commerce and culture, and rooted in the cosmopolitan currents of Cochin. Presently, it is
      Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan who leads the regional cosmopolitan heritage of Sufism, by re-presenting Islam for
      humanity’s survival as ethically mindful and morally interconnected subjects, and with the pluralist precepts to
      engage human and non-human diversity on the planet earth.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      The projects and programme laid under Jeelani Trust to realize the Sufi Islamic, social and humanitarian mission
      are being successfully carried forward to much advanced levels by the astute successor chosen by Hzt. Dr.
      Quthbuzzaman. Against all odds, Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan Shah is relentless in leading the social and moral
      mission of Hzt. Quthbuzzaman, by caring for the poor and mobilizing the masses to the horizon of piety and
      progress. Youthful and imaginative, he stands as the moral beacon of hope for the spiritually and culturally
      aspiring humanity. He keeps devising social and educational strategies to ethically equip the youth to face the
      impending challenges of the times. A humane role model, Naeb Quthbuzzaman performs the leadership for the young
      generation of citizens around the world, educating the youth in moral integrity and empowering them to selflessly
      serve humanity; what is understood to be the pressing need of the perilous present that is riven by moral
      cynicism, natural calamities and pandemics. As the Sufi leadership of the present, Naeb Quthbuzzaman Dr. Sheikh
      Nizamudhin Sulthan confidently re-presents the ethical traditions laid out by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be
      upon him) and propagated by Hzt. Quthbuzzaman, for the late-modern times of human and planetary precarities.
    </p>

    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      Naeb Quthbuzzaman has dedicated his life to the multipronged Jeelani-Sufi mission, in order to rekindle the
      sublime message of harmony between persons, places and nations, in the current world of inter-cultural distrust,
      religious and racial hatred, and the problems of terrorism and violence. Leading a pious humanitarian mission of
      Nizamia Futures for realizing a sober Sufi humanity of peace and progress, Dr. Sheikh Nizamudhin Sulthan’s promise
      is the ethical transformation of human subjectivities across the cultures around the world.
